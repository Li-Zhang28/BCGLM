# BGLMC
Develop
The BGLMC (Bayesian Generalized Linear Model for Compositional Predictors) was developed to address the challenges of analyzing compositional data, and it incorporates a sum-to-zero constraint on the coefficients. This package provides simulation code and analysis code for both continuous and binary outcomes.

# Installation
Please download the packge to your computer and put it in a workpath that your Rstudio can access to it. The codes are developped under R version 4.0.5.

This package includes 2 folders: Continuous and Binary. We introduce each of these as follows.

# Continuous
Within this folder, "simulation" includes the code for data simulation.
