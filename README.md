# BGLMC
Develop
The BGLMC (Bayesian Generalized Linear Model for Compositional Predictors) was developed to address the challenges of analyzing compositional data, and it incorporates a sum-to-zero constraint on the coefficients. This package provides simulation code and analysis code for both continuous and binary outcomes.
